# Larsen2022-GluA2
Scripts for paper: Larsen, Biggin, Jensen 2022

## Folder: PMF
Folder contains all scripts for free energy calculations usign potential of mean force (PMF).    
All-atomistic simulations.   

## Folder: MetaD_BME
Folder contains all scripts for running coarse-grained simulations enhanced with metadynamics (MetaD).    
Trajectory was reweighted using the Bayesian/Maximum Entropy algorithm (BME) to get better consistency with small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) data.
